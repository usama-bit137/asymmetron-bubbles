# asymmetron-bubbles
## Abstract
This repository contains code used to calculate static scalar field profiles for the asymmetron scalar field coupled to a dense spherical object. Here, we outline the purpose of the files presented, found in the directory called: `python/`.

## `vacuumSeed.py` 
This file calculates the scalar field profile of the asymmetron scalar field coupled a spherical object with density $\rho_s$. We use a shooting method to numerical determine scalar field profiles that settle on the minima of the potential as the scalar approaches $r\rightarrow \infty$.
